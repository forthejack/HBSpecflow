Selenium grid needs to be working on local "http://192.168.56.1:4444/" for this code to work.

Ex: java -jar C:\Users\*****\Desktop\grid\selenium-server-4.2.2.jar standalone

Change the path to your jar file path

The code is written for a single purpose and can be altered in many ways.
Such as ;
- Creating global variables for web elements instead of local variables
- Pages can be separated and exception can be thrown to be able to determine if the code is in wrong place
- Finding web element functions can be adjusted so it can throw exception itself or continue execution within need
